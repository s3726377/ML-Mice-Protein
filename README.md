# ML-Mice-Protein
The aim of this report was to observe the expression levels of proteins critical to learning in a mouse model of Down
syndrome [1]. Expression levels of 77 proteins were measured in samples of mice with Down syndrome and without Down
syndrome [1]. Mice protein expression data set from UCI repository was used to classify using some of the common
classification models such as K- Nearest Neighbour and Decision Tree and its accuracy was compared using 10-fold
validation. To achieve optimal modelling, several tuning of parameters tuning was done obtaining best scores from
validation and confusion matrix. Performance of KNN was higher than Decision Tree where accuracy score of KNN was
0.99.
